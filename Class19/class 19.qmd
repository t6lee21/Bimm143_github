Pertussis is a sever lung infection also known as whooping cough. 

We will begin by investigating the number of pertussis cases per year in the US.

This data is available on the CDC website [here](https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/surv-reporting/cases-by-year.html)

Q1. With the help of the R “addin” package datapasta assign the CDC pertussis case number data to a data frame called cdc and use ggplot to make a plot of cases numbers over time.

```{r}
#/ echo=FALSE

cdc<-data.frame(year = c(1922L,1923L,1924L,1925L,1926L,
                                        1927L,1928L,1929L,1930L,1931L,1932L,
                                        1933L,1934L,1935L,1936L,1937L,1938L,
                                        1939L,1940L,1941L,1942L,1943L,
                                        1944L,1945L,1946L,1947L,1948L,1949L,
                                        1950L,1951L,1952L,1953L,1954L,1955L,

                                        1990L,1991L,1992L,1993L,1994L,1995L,

                                        6124,2116)
     )
  
```

Lets have a look at this data.frame
```{r}
head(cdc)
```
I want to make a nice plot of cases per year

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cdc)+aes(year,cases)+geom_point()+geom_line()
```
#2. A tale of two vaccines (wP & aP)

Q2. Using the ggplot geom_vline() function add lines to your previous plot for the 1946 introduction of the wP vaccine and the 1996 switch to aP vaccine (see example in the hint below). What do you notice?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cdc)+aes(year,cases)+geom_point()+geom_line()+geom_vline(xintercept=1946, linetype="dashed",col="blue")+geom_vline(xintercept = 1996, linetype="dashed",col="red")+geom_vline(xintercept = 2019,linetype="dashed", col="green")
```
There is more immunity seen with the aP vaccine than the wP vaccine seen by the significantly lower number of cases in 1996 compared to 1946. 

Q3. Describe what happened after the introduction of the aP vaccine? Do you have a possible explanation for the observed trend?

After the introduction of the aP vaccine we see an increase of cases emerging in later years most likely due to bacterial evolution of the reluctancy to vaccinate children with emerging false information.

##3. Exploring CMI-PB data

Why is this vaccine-preventable disease on the upswing? To answer this question we need to investigate the mechanisms underlying waning protection against pertussis. This requires evaluation of pertussis-specific immune responses over time in wP and aP vaccinated individuals.

This is the goals of the CMI-PB project (https://www.cmi-pb.org/)

The CMI-PB project makes its data available via "API-endpoint" that return JSON format. 
We will use the `jsonlite` package to access this data. The main function in this package is `read_json()`
```{r}
# Allows us to read, write and process JSON data
library(jsonlite)
subject <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/subject", simplifyVector = TRUE) 
specimen <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/specimen", simplifyVector = TRUE)
titer<-read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/plasma_ab_titer", simplifyVector = TRUE)
```
Have peek at new objects

```{r}
head(subject)
```
```{r}
head(specimen)
```

```{r}
head(titer)
```

Q4. How may aP and wP infancy vaccinated subjects are in the dataset?
```{r}
table(subject$infancy_vac)
```

Q5. How many Male and Female subjects/patients are in the dataset?
```{r}
table(subject$biological_sex)
```

Q6. What is the breakdown of race and biological sex (e.g. number of Asian females, White males etc…)?
```{r}
table(subject$race, subject$biological_sex )
```

#Working with dates
Two of the columns of `subject` contain dates in the Year-Month-Day format. Recall from our last mini-project that dates and times can be annoying to work with at the best of times. However, in R we have the excellent lubridate package, which can make life allot easier. 

```{r}
library(lubridate)
today()
```
```{r}
time_length(today()-mdy("05-31-2002"),"years")
```

Q7. Using this approach determine (i) the average age of wP individuals, (ii) the average age of aP individuals; and (iii) are they significantly different?

```{r}
# Use todays date to calculate age in days
subject$age <- today() - ymd(subject$year_of_birth)
library(dplyr)

ap <- subject %>% filter(infancy_vac == "aP")

round( summary( time_length( ap$age, "years" ) ) )

wp <- subject %>% filter(infancy_vac == "wP")

round( summary( time_length( wp$age, "years" ) ) )
```
There seems to be a signifcant difference between aP and wP individuals.  

Q8. Determine the age of all individuals at time of boost?
```{r}
age_at_boost<-time_length(ymd(subject$date_of_boost) - ymd(subject$year_of_birth),"year")
age_at_boost
```
Q9. With the help of a faceted boxplot (see below), do you think these two groups are significantly different?

```{r}
ggplot(subject) +
  aes(time_length(age, "year"),
      fill=as.factor(infancy_vac)) +
  geom_histogram(show.legend=FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(infancy_vac), nrow=2) 

```
Looking at the boxplots, it seems that the two groups are significantly different with aP having less spread around lower ages and wP being more spread out emcompassing higher ages. 

#Joining multiple tables

Q9. Complete the code to join specimen and subject tables to make a new merged data frame containing all specimen records along with their associated subject details:

```{r}
meta<-inner_join(specimen,subject)
head(meta)
```

Antibody measurments in the blood of patients 

```{r}
head(titer)
```
Q10. Now using the same procedure join meta with titer data so we can further analyze this data in terms of time of visit aP/wP, male/female etc.

```{r}
abdata<-inner_join(titer,meta)
head(abdata)
```
Q11. How many specimens (i.e. entries in abdata) do we have for each isotype?

```{r}
table(abdata$isotype)
```


```{r}
igg<-abdata %>% filter (isotype=="IgG")
head(igg)
```
Boxplot of MFI_normalised  vs antigen

```{r}
ggplot(igg)+aes(MFI_normalised, antigen, col=infancy_vac)+geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
head(igg)
```
Focus on IgG to the Pertussis Toxin (PT) antigen in the 2021 dataset
```{r}
igg.pt<-igg %>% filter(antigen == "PT", dataset=="2021_dataset")
```

```{r}
ggplot(igg.pt)+aes(planned_day_relative_to_boost,MFI_normalised,col=infancy_vac,group=subject_id)+geom_point()+geom_line()+geom_vline(xintercept = 0,linetype="dashed")+geom_vline(xintercept = 14,linetype="dashed")
```
Q19.: What do you notice about the expression of this gene (i.e. when is it at it’s maximum level)?

The expression of this gene is significantly higher for the wP infancy vaccine than the aP vaccine at the maximum level suggesting that the evidence that we are getting is starting to show differentiation.
